# Spring-Boot-Projects
These are some basic Spring Boot Projects, tried for own POC and learning.

a) Content Negotiation (Returning XML/JSON response from the same controller)
b) MultiDB (For having connection to multiple DB at a time, like User and Product Databases and endpoints secured with the JWT Token)
c) Spring Boot Microservices (Basics about microservices are handled, intercommunication using kafka, sync communication, OAUTH        implementation)
